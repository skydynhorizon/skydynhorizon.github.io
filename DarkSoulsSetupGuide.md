    -- ... customize as needed
}
```

### Survival Stats Configuration
```lua
-- In SurvivalSystem.luau, modify depletion rates:
depletionRates = {
    hunger = 0.5,     -- Hunger loss per second
    thirst = 0.8,     -- Thirst loss per second
    staminaRegen = 2.0, -- Stamina regeneration rate
    healthRegen = 0.2   -- Health regeneration rate
}

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Inventory GUI not appearing**
   - Ensure all scripts are in StarterPlayerScripts as LocalScripts
   - Check that you're using R6 character models
   - Verify the integration script is loading all systems

2. **Weapon slots on wrong side**
   - The system automatically positions weapon slots on the RIGHT side
   - If they appear on the left, check for conflicts with other GUI systems

3. **Stats not updating**
   - Ensure SurvivalSystem.luau is loaded
   - Check that the integration script is connecting the systems
   - Verify no errors in the console

4. **GUI alignment issues**
   - The system uses proper alignment for all elements
   - If labels appear misaligned, check for GUI scaling issues
   - Ensure UICorner and positioning values are not overridden
